# OraAudit


OraAudits is a project I've been working on as part of the Orai Chain buildathon, and it's something I'm really passionate about. The idea came from seeing the challenges developers face with security and gas efficiency in smart contracts, so I wanted to create a tool that simplifies this process. OraAudits allows developers to add their CosmWasm smart contracts and get them audited and optimized using AI suggestions. What's great is that if they want to take things further, they can contact our team for a full audit. We also have a feature where users can put forth their ideas, and our platform helps them turn those ideas into secure and efficient smart contracts, which can be deployed with just one click from their browser. This isn’t just about making smart contracts better—it's about making the whole process more accessible. I chose to build this on Orai Chain because of its focus on AI and blockchain integration, which opens up so many possibilities. We’re even creating standards, similar to what OpenZeppelin has done for Ethereum, allowing users to import factory contracts or directly deploy various types of contracts. And soon, we’re integrating a CosmWasm IDE into our website so that anyone can write contracts directly on Orai Chain from their browser. It wasn’t easy, especially integrating AI with blockchain and ensuring that the AI suggestions were both accurate and practical, but I believe we’ve created something truly valuable for the community. In the end, OraAudits is about making smart contract development more efficient, secure, and accessible to everyone, and I’m really excited to see where it goes from here.
